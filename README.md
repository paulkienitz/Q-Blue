# Q-Blue mail packet reader for Amiga

This is an old piece of shareware, now free, which was used for reading BBS mail packets on the Amiga.
It supports the QWK and Blue Wave mail packet formats.
It was the first Blue Wave-compatible application to be supported and endorsed by the creators of the Blue Wave format.

The lengthy user manual is in Q-Blue.doc.html, which can be browsed here: http://paulkienitz.net/amiga/Q-Blue.doc.html

The revised post-shareware license is on the title page of that manual.
